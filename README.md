[IOT Management]:
I added additional project documentation in the form of both a structural and procedural diagram. 
You should be able to view the .png files in the browser

[Minimax-AI]:
For this specific project, I used file separation practices but the entire program is also available in
"tictactoe.cpp" if you want to see the whole thing. Board_node doesn't have any implementation other than accessors
and mutators so I didn't make a .cpp for that one. Additionally, the windows.h library is necessary to run the program.
